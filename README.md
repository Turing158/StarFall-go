Use Install Go Package to install dependency packages,I don't know if this can be used.
Alternatively, copy the following command to the Goland terminal and run it to install the dependency package

```bash
go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin
go get -u github.com/gin-contrib/cors
go get -u gorm.io/gorm
go get -u gorm.io/driver/mysql
go get -u github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go
go get -u github.com/go-redis/redis
go get -u github.com/mojocn/base64Captcha
go get -u github.com/jordan-wright/email
go get -u github.com/gorilla/websocket
```
